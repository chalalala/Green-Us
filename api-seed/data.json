            "Difficulty": "Easy",
            "Planting Time": "Milder months of Spring or Fall",
            "Planting (instruction)": "Loosen soil in the planting area and amend with compost. Remove plant from container and gently tease out roots or slice the root ball in several places if potbound. Dig a hole slightly deeper than the root ball and twice as wide. Place the plant in the hole so the top of the root ball is slightly above ground level. Fill in the hole, tamp down soil around the base and water well. Spacing depends on the variety.",
            "Watering": "Though drought and heat tolerant once established, it performs best with regular watering. Irrigate once or twice a week during summer.",
            "Sun Requirements": "Full Sun to Partial Shade",
            "Pruning and Training": "Abelia looks best when allowed to retain its natural shape and size. Since glossy abelia (A. xgrandiflora) blooms on new wood, prune in late winter to early spring before new growth emerges so that flowers are not sacrificed. Remove any dead or damaged branches, and thin as needed to encourage new shoots. Lightly prune to shape. Some varieties produce long, errant watershoots (thin shoots that grow out of the trunk or branches); cut those out whenever they appear. To reinvigorate your abelia, thin out up to a third of the branches every few years. Deciduous varieties that bloom on old wood (such as A. mosanensis) should be pruned lightly as needed just after flowering.",
            "Propagating": "Most shrubs can be easily propagated by cuttings, at various times of year: In spring and early summer, take softwood cuttings; In late summer to early autumn, take semi-ripe cuttings; In mid-autumn to late winter, take hardwood cuttings. You can also propagate many shrubs by a simple process called layering.",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "When planted in optimal conditions, abelia exhibits few, if any problems. Possible diseases include powdery mildew and anthracnose. Pests include aphids.",
            "Meaning/Symbols": "The name Abelia means 'breath, vapor; source of life'. The Abelia is symbolic for equality in some parts of Mexico",

            "Planting Time": "Spring",
            "Planting (instruction)": "In the border, ideally plant your agapanthus in spring. If they are growing in containers, plant them the same depth that they are in the pot. If you have bought bulbs or fleshy rhizomes, the noses should be covered with 5cm (2in) of soil.\r\n\r\n​If your soil is prone to waterlogging, or you live in a cold area, grow agapanthus in containers.\r\n\r\nIn the containers, grow single plants in 20-23cm (8-9in) in diameter containers using a loam-based compost, such as John Innes No. 2 or No. 3. All container plants (hardy or tender) benefit from some winter protection (see Overwintering below).\r",

            "Sun Requirements": "Full Sun",
            "Pruning and Training": "1. Cut off the old flower spikes after the flowers fade and before they begin to dry and set seeds. Snip through the stem with shears near its base, where it emerges from the plant.\r\n\r\n2. Prune out dead or damaged leaves at any time with clean shears. Remove the leaves at their base and discard or compost them.\r\n\r\n3. Prune back deciduous varieties to within 4 inches of the ground after the foliage dies back naturally in fall. Evergreen varieties don't require cutting back.\r\n\r\n4. Trim the foliage of both evergreen and deciduous varieties down to half the plant's height every four to six years in the fall in preparation for division. Dig up the roots with a trowel, taking care not to damage them. Cut the roots into three pieces with a knife, ensuring that each piece contains both leaves and roots. Replant the divided roots with the top 1/2-inch deep and space them 12 inches apart in all directions.",
            "Propagating": "Once plants have established between three and five years, they will be ready to be dug up and divided into smaller clumps. This is the best way to make more plants of a cultivar as all the new clumps will be exactly the same.\r\n\r\nAgapanthus can also be propagated from seed, however the resulting plants will be different from their parents. In fact each one will be unique, so you might get a gem among the seedlings.",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "It is naturally disappointing when agapanthus don't flower well. It's quite a common problem, however, and thankfully one that can be resolved.\n\nTo ensure a good display next year, keep plants well-watered until autumn after flowers start to fade, which will encourage the development of new flower buds.\n\nAlthough often said, agapanthus don't actually flower better when pot-bound. It's true they like to be cosy in their pot, flowering poorly when overpotted or over-divided, but they also flower poorly when excessively pot-bound. So do try repotting every two or three years, plus watering and feeding in spring, to improve flowering. \n\nToo much shade, cold weather and lack of winter protection are also common reasons for agapanthus to fail to flower.\n\nToo much winter warmth may lead to early flowering, but the flower quality will be poor.",
            "Meaning/Symbols": "The symbolic meaning of Agapanthus is magical love of love letter, and is derived for the Greek agape meaning “love” and anthos meaning “flower”. But be carefull when selecting the Peter Pan variety for you love may be magical but not grow beyond childhood!",

Arrange the container-grown perennials on the surface so you can see how they will look before planting\n3. Individually knock out each plant from its container. Look at the roots – if they are circling around the compost, it is best to tease them out. To do this, push your fingers into the rootball along the bottom edge and pull to rip the roots. Do this in three to four places. This will prevent the roots growing round and round and, therefore, should encourage the roots to spread into the surrounding ground\n4.

            "Watering": "Water newly planted perennials regularly for their first year, until they’re settled in. After that, most only need extra water during long dry spells.\r\n\r\nPerennials in containers should be watered regularly during the growing season, and especially in hot weather.",

If you leave them in place over winter, some may look a little untidy, but will provide valuable shelter for overwintering beneficial insects.\r\n\r\nChelsea chop – perennials that are liable to flop can be reduced in height in late May to produce stockier plants or delay flowering.",
            "Propagating": "Perennials are easy to propagate in several ways:\r\n- by dividing the clump\r\n- by taking cuttings – either softwood or semi-ripe, or root cuttings\r\n- by growing from seed, either bought or saved from your plants ",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "Perennials, especially hardy ones, are usually robust and trouble free. However, look out for the following problems:\n- Nibbled young shoots and holey leaves may be caused by slugs, snails, rabbits and mice.\n- Yellow leaves (chlorosis) may be a sign of nutrient deficiency.\n- Tall or top-heavy flower stems may flop over or break – put supports in place in spring.\n- Plants may occasionally go into decline for no apparent reason – this often starts with browning leaves and may be caused by a disease such as phytophthora or pythium root rot.",

            "Planting (instruction)": "When growing aloe vera plants, plant them in a cactus potting soil mix or a regular potting soil that has been amended with additional perlite or building sand. Also, make sure that the pot has plenty of drainage holes. Aloe vera plants cannot tolerate standing water. One important thing in the care of aloe vera houseplants is that they have proper light. Aloe vera plants need bright light, so they do best in south- or west-facing windows.",
            "Watering": "The soil of the aloe vera plant should be allowed to go completely dry before being watered. When the aloe plant is watered, the soil should be thoroughly drenched, but the water should be allowed to drain freely from the soil. The most common reason an aloe plant dies is that the owners water too often or do not allow the water to drain. Do not make this mistake when taking care of aloe houseplants.\r\n",
            "Sun Requirements": "Full Sun",
            "Pruning and Training": "To prune it, you must wait until spring arrives. Once the moment arrives, take a sharp knife (not a saw) and cut the blade from its base , close to the ground. To use the gel, it is recommended to take those that are located closer to the ground level, which are the oldest. The newest ones must be left, otherwise the plant would weaken.\r\n\r\nIf your plant has any leaf that is dry or damaged, it should be removed. It is not a plant that is affected by many pests and diseases, but if it has suffered excessive watering or has been very exposed to the sun, then we will have to “rejuvenate” it by removing those that have lost their green color.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you have small leaves, you can remove them and plant them in individual pots. To do this, you just have to remove a bit of earth around it, and separate them from the mother plant when they are at least 5cm tall . It is important that they get out with a little root, but if some are broken, do not worry. Once you are in your new pot, in a few days you will begin to broadcast new ones.",
            "Propagating": "The Division Method\n\nStep 1: Search for the pups on and around your aloe plant’s stem. Not only will they be at the stem, pups may be hiding at the base of the mother plant. They may be fully obscured by their mother’s large leaves. Each offset should have at least a few leaves and its own root system.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Take the entire plant, pups and all, out of its pot and brush away as much soil as possible. If planted in a garden bed, use a trowel to carefully loosen the soil and remove the aloe plant and its pups. Be careful not to disturb other plants growing nearby. Be careful of the root systems for both the parent aloe plant and its offsets.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Gently untangle the pups from the mother plant. If needed, use a knife to cut them free, but don’t cut the roots. Take your time with this step so that you cause as little damage as possible.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Now that it’s separated, examine the offset’s roots for any damage. Cut free rotten or unhealthy portions, keeping as much of the root intact as possible. You may want to check the mother plant’s roots for damage as well.\r\n\r\nStep 5: For offsets with few or damaged roots, dip the ends in rooting hormone to encourage new growth. While this is not always essential, rooting hormone does help with root development.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Repot the offset in dry, well-draining soil. The roots need to breathe, so don’t pack down the soil tightly. While the pups are small, they still need to adjust to the fresh soil around their root system.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Put the mother plant back in its pot. You may also use this chance to upgrade its pot for a larger one. Whether you’re doing aloe vera repotting or another plant, it’s the same process. Plants should be at the same depth they were growing at in their old pot. The same is true if your plants were in a garden bed.\r\n\r\nStep 8: It’s tempting to give your baby aloe plant some water as a housewarming gift. However, keep it dry for a few days. The roots need time to heal from the move, which is best done while the soil’s dry. Gradually begin to water your plants again after a few days to a week have passed.",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "Water issues have got to be the number one cause of problems with aloe vera. A wilting, brown aloe that has soft spots in the leaves is likely over watered. A plant with puckered leaves that are discoloring may be too dry. The leaves are a great indicator of the moisture needs of this plant. They should be plump and glossy green.\n\nTo correct any water issues, repot the plant in a well-draining soil that is at least half gritty material such as sand or pumice. Once the plant is out of soil, check the roots for any rot and remove. Water only when the soil is dry to the touch when you insert a finger to the second knuckle. In winter, reduce water by half.",

            "Planting (instruction)": "- Before planting, remove all weeds and the grass in a 4-foot diameter circle. \r\n- After you purchase the tree, protect it from injury, drying out, freezing, or overheating. If the roots have dried out, soak them in water about 24 hours before planting.\r\n- Tree spacing is influenced by the rootstock, soil fertility, and pruning. Seedlings or full-size trees should be planted about 15 to 18 feet apart in a row. A dwarfing rootstock might be 4 to 8 feet apart in a row. Of course, apple trees require cross-pollination; a different cultivar that blooms at the same time must be planted within 2,000 feet (preferably, nearer).\r\n- Dig a hole approximately twice the diameter of the root system and 2 feet deep. Place some of the loose soil back into the hole and loosen the soil on the walls of the planting hole so the roots can easily penetrate the soil. Spread the tree roots on the loose soil, making sure they are not twisted or crowded in the hole. Continue to replace soil around the roots. As you begin to cover the roots, firm the soil to be sure it surrounds the roots and to remove air pockets.\r\n- Do not add fertilizer at planting time, as the roots can be “burned”. Fill the remainder of the hole with the loose soil, and press the soil down well.\r\n- Most apple trees are grafted. The graft union must be at least 2 inches above the soil line so that roots do not emerge from the scion. The graft union (where the scion is attached to the rootstock) can be recognized by the swelling at the junction. \r\n- Dwarf apple trees are notoriously prone to uprooting under the weight of a heavy crop, so you should provide a support system for your hedge. You can grow your trees against a fence, or you can provide free-standing support in the form of a trellis.",

Large trees may need more pruning (and a ladder!). \n- Prune your mature tree when it is dormant. Completely cut away overly vigorous, upright stems (most common high up in the tree).\n- Remove weak twigs (which often hang from the undersides of limbs.\nShorten stems that become too droopy, especially those low in the tree.\n- After about ten years, fruiting spurs (stubby branches that elongate only about a half-inch per year) become overcrowded and decrepit. Cut away some of them and shorten others.\n- When a whole limb of fruiting spurs declines with age, cut it back to make room for a younger replacement.",
            "Propagating": "Commercially, apple trees are propagated by grafting or budding. New trees may be grown from seed, but they will not come true to parental type.",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "Apples are prone to insect and diseases—including apple maggots, plum curculios, green fruitworms, and codling moths. Many gardeners who swear off pesticides find they need to find, at minimum, an acceptual annual spray treatment for a decent crop.\n\nOne idea to avoid pesticides is to select disease-resistant varieties such as ‘Prima’, ‘Priscilla’, ‘Liberty’, and ‘Freedom’. They do not require spraying for apple scab, cedar-apple rust, and other common diseases, while most other varieties require periodic spraying every spring and summer after planting. Check with your extension service to find approved pest prevention programs for your area.\n\nYou can also try an anti-insect oil, found at garden stores. Spray it in the spring when your apple trees are in the tight cluster stage: after the leaves have unfolded from the fruiting cluster, but before the buds begin to show pink.\n\nOther pests such as scales, mites, and aphids should be controlled by natural parasite and predator populations if you haven’t used a lot of sprays. \n\nThe apple maggot  can be trapped simply enough by hanging one or two round, softball-size balls—painted red and coated with sticky “Tangle-Trap”—from a branch in June through the summer. Reapply the sticky goo a time or two, as necessary.\n\nKeep deer at bay with repellents, fencing, or deer-resistant plants; deter mice and rabbits with wire-mesh cylinders around the base of the tree.\n\nTo keep insects away from apple trees, make a solution of 1 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 quart of water. Pour this mixture into a widemouthed plastic jug. Hang the jug, uncovered, in your apple tree.\n\nFend off diseases by raking apple leaves, burying them beneath mulch, or grinding them with a lawnmower at season’s end",
            "Meaning/Symbols": "Though the forbidden fruit in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition holds that Adam and Eve ate an apple from the forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden. The unnamed fruit of Eden thus became an apple under the influence of the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man and sin.",

            "Planting (instruction)": "1. Ideally position boundary hedges so they are set back a little way (e.g. 90cm/3ft) from the boundary line. This will allow the hedge to fill out before it becomes an issue with overhanging the pavement or a neighbour's property\r\n2. Within the row planting distances vary from 30-60cm (1-2ft), depending on the plants’ final size, the size of hedge required and plant vigour. For hedges thicker than 90cm (3ft), plant a staggered double row 45cm (18in) apart, with plants 90cm (3ft) apart\r\n3. Trim back damaged roots to healthy growth with sharp knife or old pair of secateurs\r\n4. Spread out the roots, ensuring the planting depth is correct. The point where the roots flare out from the stem should be level with the surrounding soil; on container-grown plants, scrape away the compost from the top of the root ball to reveal this point\r\n5. On sandy or heavy clay soils, mix organic matter, such as garden compost or a proprietary tree and shrub planting mix, with the soil dug out from the hole to backfill. Alternatively, spread over the soil surface and mix into the top 25cm (10in) of soil with a fork (forking in)\r\n6. Work soil between the roots, firm plants in so that soil is in close contact with the roots. Water if the soil is dry\r\n7. Mulch to a depth of 7.5cm (3in) after planting to prevent weeds",
            "Watering": "Continue to water your beech trees and hedges for the first season or two after planting, paying particular attention during dry spells in spring or summer.",
            "Sun Requirements": "Sun or Partial Shade",
            "Pruning and Training": "Beech hedging\nNewly planted: There is no need to prune your new hedging plants if they have plenty of side branches. If plants are sparse, however, help thicken them up by shortening the leading shoot and longer shoots by up to one third. Do this in winter or straight after planting. Repeat in the second year if the plants still look a bit leggy.\n\nFrom the third year onwards, trim the sides of the hedge in the second week of August. The top can be pruned when your beech hedge reaches the height you want to keep it at. If you aim for a width of about 1m (3¼ft) at the base and a flat-topped A-shape (in cross section), the hedge will be well-shaped with plenty of sunlight reaching the top and bottom.\n\nEstablished hedge: Trim your beech hedge each August to keep it to the size you want. This late summer trimming allows the hedge to retain its recent flush of new leaves over the winter in a brown, autumnal state, providing year-round screening. If you miss pruning in August just trim the following spring instead (don’t disturb nesting birds though – see the Top Tip below).\n\nOvergrown hedge: Don’t be afraid to cut back hard an overgrown beech hedge in February while it is still dormant but wait a while if the weather is very cold. If you need to reduce the height or sides by half or more, it’s best to stagger pruning over two seasons rather than doing it all at once. Cut one side and the top in the first year, leaving the other side to the second year. If your hedge is slow to regrow after the first prune, postpone the second cut back for a further twelve months.\n\nBeech trees\nAllow your young specimen trees to keep their lower side branches until the crown has matured a little. This is to discourage the formation of more than one leading shoot (multiple leaders spoil the shape of the tree and can be prone to failure if allowed to mature) and to protect the main stem from sun scorch.\n\nPrune a beech tree, if necessary, between autumn and early spring. It is usual to create a clear trunk of 2.4-3m (8-10ft) to allow the sweeping lower branches some space to develop. Cuts with a diameter larger than 6cm (2½in) may not heal so readily so try to keep these to a minimum. ",
            "Propagating": "The easiest method to propagate beech (Fagus sylvatica) is from seed by collecting ripe beech nuts or ‘masts’ in late summer or autumn. You can either sow them straight away or store them in the fridge to sow in February which helps avoid rodent problems in winter. Sow seeds individually in deep, narrow containers such as Rootrainers and place them outdoors. Alternatively, sow directly into a sandy seed bed. Seeds germinate at 10°C (50°F). Seedlings collected from purple or copper-leaved trees are likely to vary in the level of red or purple pigmentation.\r\n\r\nGrowing from seed is a cheap technique for propagating large numbers of beech plants such as when you need them for hedging. It takes a little longer than buying plants but beech is quick growing so can be worth it. To grow seedling beech to a reasonable size, i.e. 30-60cm (1-2ft) before planting them out as hedge plants, lift and replant the saplings in the same soil 18 months after germination (after two seasons’ growth). This deliberate root disturbance encourages a branched, fibrous root system to develop, rather than a single deep tap root, helping the young beech plants to establish quickly when they are planted in their final position.\n",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "Once established beech are pretty reliable but watch out for the following:\r\n- Woolly beech aphids can look alarming but don’t usually do much damage\r\n- Protect young plants from rabbit and deer stripping which can quickly ring bark trees especially in cold weather or after snowfall\r\n- Beech heart rots caused by the fungus Ganoderma can weaken mature trees, causing them to fail\r\n- Signs of ill health or the death of mature beech trees or hedging can also be due to the very common disease honey fungus\r\nProlonged drought will cause beech trees to suffer.",

A single plant can be incredibly productive, but if you plant more make sure they have plenty of room. Spacing depends on the vigour of the cultivar, ranging from 2.5m (8ft) to 4.5m (13ft) apart. When planting, cover the rootball with about 8cm (3in) of soil.\r\n\r\nVigorous cultivars need a sturdy support system.

It may be worth noting that although box hedging and topiary can be pruned towards the end of May, pruning at this time may leave the new flush of soft growth vulnerable to weather damage such as leaf scorch, the result of late frosts, drying winds or unseasonably hot sun and, additionally, diseases such as box blight. Pruning later during August, when the new growth has hardened off and slowed down, should help minimise leaf damage due to weather conditions or disease and the hedge should remain neat through the winter months.\r\n\r\nOld, neglected plants usually respond well to hard pruning in late spring (May) and can be cut back to within 15-30cm (6in-1ft) of the ground.",

Cuttings will root in the open ground if the soil is moist and there is some shade. More reliable results come from placing cuttings in a cold frame or similar environment. A heated propagator will speed the rooting process, and you should see roots after eight weeks, as opposed to up to eight months without heat.\n\nGrow on the cuttings, pinching out the tips regularly. In the autumn plant out into a nursery bed, spacing plants 30-45cm (1ft-18in) apart and grow on for three to four years.\n\nFor growing from seed, sow seed in autumn or early spring and place in a cold frame. It may take four to five years to obtain transplants. Buxus sempervirens and its cultivars can also be divided in spring using a spade.

Leaves\r\n- Excessive sunlight can cause discoloration and sun-scald to leaves\r\n- General bronzing or an orange coloration of the foliage is also due to environmental stress usually following hot, dry spells in summer, although a contributing factor may be root damage due to winter waterlogging\r\n- General yellowing of foliage may be symptomatic of waterlogging, especially on heavy clay soils\r\n- Over winter, leaf tips and margins commonly yellow due to low temperatures\r\n- Leaf discoloration will tend to be more common in exposed sites\r\n- Young growth in spring can also get caught by frost, turning them pale brown and often papery-looking\r\nAn application of fertiliser in spring to encourage fresh new growth, along with clipping, usually rectifies these problems.\r\n\r\n2. Roots\r\nRoots subjected to waterlogging are usually a blue-black colour in cross section and fall apart when teased out. Damaged roots should be removed, top growth trimmed back and the box replanted.\r\n\r\n3. Pest and diseases\r\nBox may sometimes suffer from the following problems: box sucker, box tree caterpillar, plant establishment problems, red spider mite and scale insects. If in doubt, our page on box problems is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nBox blight and other problems can be a considerable issue, making it almost impossible to grow neat, unaffected hedges.

In colder climates, bury the bud union one to two inches below ground level. This union should always be protected in cold winters.",
            "Watering": "As with most garden plants, one to two inches of water per week is usually sufficient, but this varies by climate and growing conditions. Hot locations and sandy soil will need more frequent watering than cool, coastal regions. A simpler rule is to water when the top three inches of soil are dry.\r\n\r\nWater the soil, not the leaves, to prevent disease. Also, water deeply to encourage root growth.

First cut out anything dead, diseased, or damaged canes as well as scrawny, spindly canes of less than 1/2 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nPrune remaining stronger canes by about a third of their length, down to 12 to 24 inches. Hard-pruning like this encourages strong stems and large flowers. It also opens and shapes the plant so it can put more energy into fewer flowers.\r\n\r\nWhen cutting roses, be sure to leave a few leaves on the stem, making cuts about 1/4 inch above an outward-facing bud.

Now it takes about six to eight weeks for the plant to unfold its flowers.",
            "Watering": "During the flowering and growth phases Hippeastrum need a lot of water.\n- water until the soil becomes moist\n- since the bulb is slightly rotten, the plant should not be watered from above.

This simulates the dry phase, which the plant is accustomed to from its subtropical home. In this way you initiate the dormant period and allow the plant to extract important nutrients from the leaves and store them in the bulb. During the dormant period the plant is not watered.\nWhen the bulb re-sprouts at the end of the dormant period, start again with the water supply. However, the shoot should be one to two inches high before you water it. If you start too early, it stimulates leaf growth, which can lead to a lack of flowers.",

            "Watering": "Newly planted lavender should be watered regularly during its first summer.\n\nAfter that, once it’s well established, lavender is drought tolerant so rarely needs watering when grown in the ground unless there are severe drought conditions.\n\nPlants in containers do need regular water in summer, as they dry out quickly, and the roots have a limited amount soil in which to search for moisture. In winter, keep the containers fairly dry, maybe in a cold greenhouse or in the rain shadow at the base of a wall to keep off excessive rain, which will help improve the plants’ tolerance to cold weather.",
            "Sun Requirements": "Full Sun",
            "Pruning and Training": "Left to their own devices, lavender can become woody and ungainly, so to keep plants compact and attractive, it’s best to trim them annually in late summer, just after flowering has finished. Remove any spent flower stalks and about 2.5cm (1in) of leaf growth. Foliage can be clipped over in spring if growth is untidy or frost damaged. Lavender does not break new growth easily from old stems so don't cut back into the woody stems.\n\nEven if pruned annually, older lavender plants can become straggly, very woody and mis-shapen so, as they are fast growing and establish quickly, they are best replaced if you want to keep everything looking neat.",

To encourage new growth and keep the plant full, it helps to prune at least 3 to 10 inches from the tips in spring. As with all roses, don’t prune if a frost is anticipated within six weeks, to avoid winter dieback.",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "Rugosa is lower maintenance than other rose species, but it is a rose and it can be susceptible to the usual diseases, like black spot and stem canker.

            "Difficulty": "Easy",
            "Planting Time": "Spring or Fall",
            "Planting (instruction)": "Tulips need a chilling period and are planted in the fall. Planting depth should be about 3 times the bulb's diameter; small bulbs will be about 5 to 6 inches deep, larger bulbs 8 to 10 inches. Add a handful of bulb food or bone meal at planting time and water well. If it doesn't rain, you must water the bulbs weekly until the ground freezes. Feed again, when the leaves emerge in the spring.",
            "Watering": "- If it rains weekly, do not water. However, if there is a dry spell and it does not rain, you should water the bulbs weekly until the ground freezes. \n- Rainy summers, irrigation systems, and wet soil are death to tulips. Never deliberately water a bulb bed unless in a drought. Wet soil leads to fungus and disease and can rot bulbs. Add shredded pine bark, sand, or any other rough material to the soil to foster swift drainage.\n- In the spring, when leaves emerge, feed your tulip the same bulb food or bone meal which you used at planting time. Water well.",
            "Sun Requirements": "Full sun",
            "Pruning and Training": "Tulips do not need pruning or training. Simply remove the withered stems and foliage in summer once they have turned straw-coloured. Stems usually come away easily without needing to cut them.   ",
            "Propagating": "By offsets: These are immature bulbs that naturally form around the main bulb. They can be detatched when lifting plants and stored dry over summer. Replant offsets in autumn at least 20cm (8in) deep. Small offsets may take three to four years to reach flowering size. \r\n\r\nBy seed: Try this method with smaller Specialist tulips, as Border types don't produce seed readily. Sow papery seed collected in the current year in pots or trays of loam-based compost such as Melcourt SylvaGrow with added John Innes. Lightly cover the seed with sieved compost, and finish with a ½cm (¼in) inch layer of horticultural grit. Seed need chilling to germinate, so leave container outdoors. Seedlings appear in spring and typically take three to four years to reach flowering size.",
            "Problems (Pest/Disease)": "Tulips sometimes suffer from pest and diseases, especially where grown in the same soil for long periods. Growing conditions may also affect their health.  \n\n- Where plants fail to flower, feed with tomato fertiliser while in growth. This boosts the nutrients returned to the bulb, helping to form flowers for next year. On wetter soils, that don't dry out in summer, reflowering of border tulips is difficult  \n- Many smaller bulbs that do not flower is caused by shallow planting. Replant bulbs at least three times their depth in the ground \n- Tulips with short stems maybe due to late planting, or mild winters    \n- Grey squirrels often dig up bulbs. In containers protect bulbs with chicken wire. In the ground plant bulbs in aquatic baskets covered with chicken wire. Wire can be removed once leaves emerge  \n- Aphids may affect stored bulbs as well as leaves \n- During early spring, slugs can damage foliage and flowers  \n- Streaking and spotting on the petals and leaves indicates tulip viruses, but can also be tulip fire, or grey mould (botrytis)  \n- Tulip fire causes brown spotting and distortion to the petals and leaves. Less frequently distortion can also be caused by stem and bulb eelworm   \n- Soil-borne fungal disease sclerotinia leads to bulb rot. Promptly remove affected plants and don't plant bulbs in this area for five years. Rots can also affect bulbs in storage ",
            "Meaning/Symbols": "The meaning of tulips is generally perfect love. Like many flowers, different colors of tulips also often carry their own significance.

Because of this variety, it's important to choose carefully. If you are looking for the familiar rose bush, consider hybrid teas, floribundas, or shrub roses. Hybrid teas are tall, long-stemmed roses ideal for cutting. Floribundas are shorter and bloom more freely, setting clusters of blossoms rather than a single bloom on a stem. Both these require regular maintenance for optimum performance. Shrub roses (sometimes called landscape roses), on the other hand, require somewhat less attention, adapt more readily to a wider range of conditions, and offer more disease resistance",

            "Choosing site to grow": "Garlic is best grown in Full Sun (at least 6 hours a day) and well-drained soil rich with organic matter. Prepare the garden bed by using a garden fork or tiller to loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches, then mix in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost. Consider planting it as a border around your garden to act as a natural insect repellent. You can also plant it in rows between lettuce, eggplants, cabbage, broccoli or tomatoes. Keep your garlic plantings away from beans and peas as it could hinder their growth.",
            "Planting instructions": "Like onions, garlic is great for wide-row growing. Plant the cloves the full depth of the bulb , three or four inches apart, and firm the soil. Try a row 10 to 12 inches wide. To grow big garlic bulbs, plant the cloves in late fall. They'll mature the following summer. If you live in the North you can mulch garlic over the winter, but next season you'll have to watch out for seed stalks and pick them off right away. If you have a long growing season, you can also plant the cloves in the spring as soon as the ground can be worked. However, the resulting heads will be smaller than fall-planted garlic. If you live in the South or Southwest, plant the cloves anytime from the fall through early spring. Plant early because garlic isn't fond of hot weather. It doesn't like competition from weeds, either.",
            "Ongoing Care": "Keep your garlic mulched and well watered from spring through early summer and remove competing weed growth. If you notice any flower stalks growing, be sure to prune them off whenever they appear. Removing flower stalks will help redirect energy to the bulb.",
            "How to harvest": "Harvest garlic when the tops have only six to eight green leaves left or when most of the leaves have turned brown. Be sure to dig the bulbs within 2 weeks of the leaves browning, otherwise the papery covering surrounding the bulb will begin to deteriorate and cause the bulb to break apart . Pull the heads up and let them dry for a few days, and then cure them in an airy place, like onions. They'll keep for quite a while at 40deg F to 60deg F. Braiding is an excellent way to store them.\r"

Another dozen or so mint varieties, including some interesting fruit-scented types such as orange mint, are also available.",
            "Choosing site to grow": "Choose a site in Full Sun to part shade and moist soil. Or, since plants can be invasive, grow your mint in containers filled with potting mix enriched with compost.",
            "Planting instructions": "If you want an entire bed of mint, start with one or two purchased plants and set them about 2 feet apart in a sunny location. They'll quickly fill in the open area between plants.\r\n\r\nAmend the soil well before planting with compost to help keep the soil moist. Remove all weeds, especially perennial ones, from the area, since it's painstaking to weed mint plants once planted. Set mint plants in the garden spaced 1- to 2-feet apart after all danger of frost has passed in your area. Mulch plants with bark or straw mulch to keep the soil moist and weed free. If you want to grow mint from seed, sow indoors 8 weeks before you'll be transplanting outdoors.\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid having your mint take over, plant varieties in bottomless pots sunk into the ground. The underground rhizomes won't be able to spread as aggressively.\r\n\r\nMint also grows well as an indoor herb plant. Move potted mint plants indoors before a killing frost. Give them plenty of light, cut back on watering in winter, and you'll get plants from which you can harvest some leaves in winter and plant back into the garden in spring.",
            "Ongoing Care": "Mint requires little care to keep it growing. If planting a patch of different types of mint, keep the more aggressive ones from taking over by containing them, or by digging and dividing them annually in spring. Mint varieties will cross pollinate but it will only affect the seedlings that grow from the seeds that develop as a result of the pollination. Pull out seedlings or you'll get hybrids that won't taste like the mother plant. Also, if allowed to grow together, it may be hard to distinguish one mint variety from another when picking.\r\n\r\nTo share your mints, in spring dig and divide mother plants. Mint also readily roots from cuttings. Snip a 4- to 6-inch cutting from the mother plant, dip the cut end in rooting hormone powder, remove all but the top set of leaves, stick the cuttings in a pot filled with moistened potting soil, and place in a bright room, out of direct sun. Cuttings should root in about 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nIn fall, cut back plants, especially aggressive ones, to limit their growth and remove any diseased leaves. Mints generally don't have problems with insects and diseases, but sometimes rust disease will attack and can be controlled by removing and destroying the leaves in fall.",
            "How to harvest": "Harvest mint leaves as needed once the plant is established. For fresh use, pick the youngest leaves before the plant flowers, just after the dew dries in the morning for best flavor. If harvesting for drying, cut 6-inch long mint stems, bunch them together, and hang them in a well ventilated, 70 degree F, airy room out of direct sunlight. Place a brown paper bag around the bunch to retain the leaves color and oil content. They should be dry in about 1 to 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nYou can also dry mint leaves in an oven set at 185 degrees F, a microwave, or food dehydrator. Watch leaves carefully so they don't burn."

            "Planting instructions": "Start seeds indoors six weeks before the last frost date or seed directly in the garden (about 1/4 inch deep) after the last frost date when soil is warm. Set transplants or thin seedlings to stand at least 10 to 12 inches apart; more room (16 to 24 inches apart) will encourage low, bushy plants to develop.",
            "Ongoing Care": "Pinch off the center shoot of the basil plant after it has grown for 6 weeks to force side growth and prevent early flowering. If flower stalks do develop, cut them off. Mulch is recommended in hot areas since basil likes a steady moisture supply. Basil is generally pest-free. Early cold weather can ruin a maturing crop, so be sure to harvest if temperatures are expected to dip below 40 degrees F.",
            "How to harvest": "Basil is at its most pungent when fresh. The best time to harvest is just as the plant starts to bud, well before flowers bloom. Snip leaves or branches at this time and pinch off flower buds to keep the plant productive. You also can cut the entire plant about 6 to 8 inches above ground, leaving at least one node with two young shoots intact. The plant should produce a second but smaller harvest several weeks later.\r\n\r\nSince the leaves lose some of their flavor when dried, freezing is the best method for winter storage. To quick-freeze basil, dry whole sprigs and pack them in plastic bags with the air pressed out. To dry basil, pinch off the leaves at the stem and dry them in a shady, well-ventilated area. Check in 3 or 4 days, and if they are not totally dry, finish drying in the oven, otherwise the leaves may turn brown or black. Use the lowest heat possible with the door slightly open, turn leaves for even drying, and check frequently.\r\n\r"

In most other areas, you'll save several weeks of growing time by transplanting potted plants that are already up and growing.\r\n\r\nTo make watering and fertilizing easier, consider planting three tubers (or plants) in 6-inch pots and sink the pots up to their rims in the beds. The pots collect and hold water, stave off invasions from thirsty tree roots, and make it simple to lift and collect the tubers in fall.",

Indoors, the plants should be kept in a heated greenhouse or sunny window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard-size orange and grapefruit trees grow 18 to 22 feet tall; dwarf varieties grow 8 to 12 feet tall. Most Lemon trees begin to bear at three to six years. Pollination is generally accomplished by insects and sometimes by the wind. Indoor gardeners can hand-pollinate. Most Lemon varieties are self-fertile so you need only one tree.",

            "Ongoing Care": "Columbine is prone to a fungal disease called powdery mildew. The spores spread through splashing water and travel on wind currents to infect other plants. Once established, powdery mildew is difficult to control. Most fungal diseases develop during rainy, wet weather, but powdery mildew develops when daytime temperatures are warm and nights are cool. The disease is not dependent on water on the leaves. You can help your columbines resist the disease by cutting back the affected plant parts (down to ground level if necessary), providing afternoon sunshine, and lots of air circulation in and around the plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most common pest on columbine is leaf miner. These fly larvae feed inside the leaf. You'll see their damage as light-colored, winding tunnels on the leaf surfaces. Cut off and destroy all infested foliage after plants have bloomed; the new leaves that regrow later in the season will be miner-free.\r\n\r"

One way is to dig a 6 inch deep trench and set the seedlings 6 inches apart in a row in the bottom of the trench. As they plants grow, gradually fill in the trench with soil, blanching the stalks in the process. You can also plant leek seedlings 8-10 inches apart in a wide row by poking holes with the handle of a rake or hoe about 6 inches deep, then dropping the seedlings into the holes. Water after you've set the seedlings in the holes and enough soil will wash in around them to cover the roots. The holes will fill in gradually on their own as the plants grow, covering the developing stalks. You can hill up additional soil around the plants to produce the longest white stalks.\r\n\r\nTo grow a crop to overwinter in southern areas, sow seeds 8-12 weeks before the first expected fall frost.",

Silvery or rusty looking streaks on the leaves are signs of thrips damage; hose these pests off with a strong stream of water.",
            "How to harvest": "Begin harvesting leeks as soon as they are big enough to use; the slender young stalks are tasty braised. But for the biggest stalks, let short-season leeks grow until just before the first fall frosts. Be sure to loosen the soil around the leeks with a garden fork before pulling them up so they don't break off. Let the hardy long-season leeks remain in the garden until just before the ground freezes or throughout the winter in southern gardens. Mulching around the plants in fall with straw can extend your harvest season by keeping the soil from freezing. You can also harvest overwintered leeks in early spring before these biennial plants send up a flower stalk; after that, they'll be stringy and tough.\r\n\r\nHarvested leeks will keep wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks; cut off all but a few inches of the green tops to make them easier to store."

            "Special Feature": "Dart's golden ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius 'Dart's golden') - is a more compact shrub with light striking yellow spring foliage fading to a chartreuse yellow-green in summer. It has showy white flowering clusters in early summer and fantastic golden-orange fall color.",
            "Choosing site to grow": "Ninebark grows best in acidic, well-drained soil in Full Sun to partial shade, but is adaptable to many soil conditions.",
            "Planting instructions": "Prepare the garden bed by using a garden fork or tiller to loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches, then mix in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost. Dig a hole twice the diameter of the pot the plant is in. Carefully remove the plant from its container and place it in the hole so the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface. Carefully fill in around the root ball and firm the soil gently. Water thoroughly.",
            "Ongoing Care": "Water regularly until established. After it's established, ninebark is drought-tolerant. You can propagate from hardwood cuttings. Established shrubs require annual pruning to maintain their shape. Prune early each spring by removing some of the oldest branches by cutting them off at the base. Do not ingest this plant, as all parts of the ninebark are known to be poisonous."
