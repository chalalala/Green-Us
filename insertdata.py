Since glossy abelia (A. xgrandiflora) blooms on new wood, prune in late winter to early spring before new growth emerges so that flowers are not sacrificed. Remove any dead or damaged branches, and thin as needed to encourage new shoots. Lightly prune to shape. Some varieties produce long, errant watershoots (thin shoots that grow out of the trunk or branches); cut those out whenever they appear. To reinvigorate your abelia, thin out up to a third of the branches every few years. Deciduous varieties that bloom on old wood (such as A. mosanensis) should be pruned lightly as needed just after flowering.",

Snip through the stem with shears near its base, where it emerges from the plant.\r\n\r\n2. Prune out dead or damaged leaves at any time with clean shears. Remove the leaves at their base and discard or compost them.\r\n\r\n3. Prune back deciduous varieties to within 4 inches of the ground after the foliage dies back naturally in fall. Evergreen varieties don't require cutting back.\r\n\r\n4. Trim the foliage of both evergreen and deciduous varieties down to half the plant's height every four to six years in the fall in preparation for division. Dig up the roots with a trowel, taking care not to damage them. Cut the roots into three pieces with a knife, ensuring that each piece contains both leaves and roots. Replant the divided roots with the top 1/2-inch deep and space them 12 inches apart in all directions.",
    "propagating": "Once plants have established between three and five years, they will be ready to be dug up and divided into smaller clumps. This is the best way to make more plants of a cultivar as all the new clumps will be exactly the same.\r\n\r\nAgapanthus can also be propagated from seed, however the resulting plants will be different from their parents. In fact each one will be unique, so you might get a gem among the seedlings.",
    "disease": "It is naturally disappointing when agapanthus don't flower well. It's quite a common problem, however, and thankfully one that can be resolved.\n\nTo ensure a good display next year, keep plants well-watered until autumn after flowers start to fade, which will encourage the development of new flower buds.\n\nAlthough often said, agapanthus don't actually flower better when pot-bound. It's true they like to be cosy in their pot, flowering poorly when overpotted or over-divided, but they also flower poorly when excessively pot-bound. So do try repotting every two or three years, plus watering and feeding in spring, to improve flowering. \n\nToo much shade, cold weather and lack of winter protection are also common reasons for agapanthus to fail to flower.\n\nToo much winter warmth may lead to early flowering, but the flower quality will be poor.",
    "meaning": "The symbolic meaning of Agapanthus is magical love of love letter, and is derived for the Greek agape meaning “love” and anthos meaning “flower”. But be carefull when selecting the Peter Pan variety for you love may be magical but not grow beyond childhood!",

Also, make sure that the pot has plenty of drainage holes. Aloe vera plants cannot tolerate standing water. One important thing in the care of aloe vera houseplants is that they have proper light. Aloe vera plants need bright light, so they do best in south- or west-facing windows.",
    "watering": "The soil of the aloe vera plant should be allowed to go completely dry before being watered. When the aloe plant is watered, the soil should be thoroughly drenched, but the water should be allowed to drain freely from the soil. The most common reason an aloe plant dies is that the owners water too often or do not allow the water to drain. Do not make this mistake when taking care of aloe houseplants.\r\n",
    "sunrequirements": "Full Sun",
    "prunetrain": "To prune it, you must wait until spring arrives. Once the moment arrives, take a sharp knife (not a saw) and cut the blade from its base , close to the ground. To use the gel, it is recommended to take those that are located closer to the ground level, which are the oldest. The newest ones must be left, otherwise the plant would weaken.\r\n\r\nIf your plant has any leaf that is dry or damaged, it should be removed. It is not a plant that is affected by many pests and diseases, but if it has suffered excessive watering or has been very exposed to the sun, then we will have to “rejuvenate” it by removing those that have lost their green color.\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you have small leaves, you can remove them and plant them in individual pots. To do this, you just have to remove a bit of earth around it, and separate them from the mother plant when they are at least 5cm tall . It is important that they get out with a little root, but if some are broken, do not worry. Once you are in your new pot, in a few days you will begin to broadcast new ones.",
    "propagating": "The Division Method\n\nStep 1: Search for the pups on and around your aloe plant’s stem. Not only will they be at the stem, pups may be hiding at the base of the mother plant. They may be fully obscured by their mother’s large leaves. Each offset should have at least a few leaves and its own root system.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Take the entire plant, pups and all, out of its pot and brush away as much soil as possible. If planted in a garden bed, use a trowel to carefully loosen the soil and remove the aloe plant and its pups. Be careful not to disturb other plants growing nearby. Be careful of the root systems for both the parent aloe plant and its offsets.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Gently untangle the pups from the mother plant. If needed, use a knife to cut them free, but don’t cut the roots. Take your time with this step so that you cause as little damage as possible.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Now that it’s separated, examine the offset’s roots for any damage. Cut free rotten or unhealthy portions, keeping as much of the root intact as possible. You may want to check the mother plant’s roots for damage as well.\r\n\r\nStep 5: For offsets with few or damaged roots, dip the ends in rooting hormone to encourage new growth. While this is not always essential, rooting hormone does help with root development.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Repot the offset in dry, well-draining soil. The roots need to breathe, so don’t pack down the soil tightly. While the pups are small, they still need to adjust to the fresh soil around their root system.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Put the mother plant back in its pot. You may also use this chance to upgrade its pot for a larger one. Whether you’re doing aloe vera repotting or another plant, it’s the same process. Plants should be at the same depth they were growing at in their old pot. The same is true if your plants were in a garden bed.\r\n\r\nStep 8: It’s tempting to give your baby aloe plant some water as a housewarming gift. However, keep it dry for a few days. The roots need time to heal from the move, which is best done while the soil’s dry. Gradually begin to water your plants again after a few days to a week have passed.",
    "disease": "Water issues have got to be the number one cause of problems with aloe vera. A wilting, brown aloe that has soft spots in the leaves is likely over watered. A plant with puckered leaves that are discoloring may be too dry. The leaves are a great indicator of the moisture needs of this plant. They should be plump and glossy green.\n\nTo correct any water issues, repot the plant in a well-draining soil that is at least half gritty material such as sand or pumice. Once the plant is out of soil, check the roots for any rot and remove. Water only when the soil is dry to the touch when you insert a finger to the second knuckle. In winter, reduce water by half.",

    "instruction": "- Before planting, remove all weeds and the grass in a 4-foot diameter circle. \r\n- After you purchase the tree, protect it from injury, drying out, freezing, or overheating. If the roots have dried out, soak them in water about 24 hours before planting.\r\n- Tree spacing is influenced by the rootstock, soil fertility, and pruning. Seedlings or full-size trees should be planted about 15 to 18 feet apart in a row. A dwarfing rootstock might be 4 to 8 feet apart in a row. Of course, apple trees require cross-pollination; a different cultivar that blooms at the same time must be planted within 2,000 feet (preferably, nearer).\r\n- Dig a hole approximately twice the diameter of the root system and 2 feet deep. Place some of the loose soil back into the hole and loosen the soil on the walls of the planting hole so the roots can easily penetrate the soil. Spread the tree roots on the loose soil, making sure they are not twisted or crowded in the hole. Continue to replace soil around the roots. As you begin to cover the roots, firm the soil to be sure it surrounds the roots and to remove air pockets.\r\n- Do not add fertilizer at time, as the roots can be “burned”. Fill the remainder of the hole with the loose soil, and press the soil down well.\r\n- Most apple trees are grafted. The graft union must be at least 2 inches above the soil line so that roots do not emerge from the scion. The graft union (where the scion is attached to the rootstock) can be recognized by the swelling at the junction. \r\n- Dwarf apple trees are notoriously prone to uprooting under the weight of a heavy crop, so you should provide a support system for your hedge. You can grow your trees against a fence, or you can provide free-standing support in the form of a trellis.",

    "sunrequirements": "Full Sun",
    "prunetrain": "Prune yearly to maintain size and form once your apple tree has filled in and is bearing fruit. Pruning reduces disease by letting in more light and air. Large trees may need more pruning (and a ladder!). \n- Prune your mature tree when it is dormant. Completely cut away overly vigorous, upright stems (most common high up in the tree).\n- Remove weak twigs (which often hang from the undersides of limbs.\nShorten stems that become too droopy, especially those low in the tree.\n- After about ten years, fruiting spurs (stubby branches that elongate only about a half-inch per year) become overcrowded and decrepit. Cut away some of them and shorten others.\n- When a whole limb of fruiting spurs declines with age, cut it back to make room for a younger replacement.",
    "propagating": "Commercially, apple trees are propagated by grafting or budding. New trees may be grown from seed, but they will not come true to parental type.",
    "disease": "Apples are prone to insect and diseases—including apple maggots, plum curculios, green fruitworms, and codling moths. Many gardeners who swear off pesticides find they need to find, at minimum, an acceptual annual spray treatment for a decent crop.\n\nOne idea to avoid pesticides is to select disease-resistant varieties such as ‘Prima’, ‘Priscilla’, ‘Liberty’, and ‘Freedom’. They do not require spraying for apple scab, cedar-apple rust, and other common diseases, while most other varieties require periodic spraying every spring and summer after planting. Check with your extension service to find approved pest prevention programs for your area.\n\nYou can also try an anti-insect oil, found at garden stores. Spray it in the spring when your apple trees are in the tight cluster stage: after the leaves have unfolded from the fruiting cluster, but before the buds begin to show pink.\n\nOther pests such as scales, mites, and aphids should be controlled by natural parasite and predator populations if you haven’t used a lot of sprays. \n\nThe apple maggot  can be trapped simply enough by hanging one or two round, softball-size balls—painted red and coated with sticky “Tangle-Trap”—from a branch in June through the summer. Reapply the sticky goo a time or two, as necessary.\n\nKeep deer at bay with repellents, fencing, or deer-resistant plants; deter mice and rabbits with wire-mesh cylinders around the base of the tree.\n\nTo keep insects away from apple trees, make a solution of 1 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 quart of water. Pour this mixture into a widemouthed plastic jug. Hang the jug, uncovered, in your apple tree.\n\nFend off diseases by raking apple leaves, burying them beneath mulch, or grinding them with a lawnmower at season’s end",
    "meaning": "Though the forbidden fruit in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition holds that Adam and Eve ate an apple from the forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden.

If you aim for a width of about 1m (3¼ft) at the base and a flat-topped A-shape (in cross section), the hedge will be well-shaped with plenty of sunlight reaching the top and bottom.\n\nEstablished hedge: Trim your beech hedge each August to keep it to the size you want. This late summer trimming allows the hedge to retain its recent flush of new leaves over the winter in a brown, autumnal state, providing year-round screening. If you miss pruning in August just trim the following spring instead (don’t disturb nesting birds though – see the Top Tip below).\n\nOvergrown hedge: Don’t be afraid to cut back hard an overgrown beech hedge in February while it is still dormant but wait a while if the weather is very cold. If you need to reduce the height or sides by half or more, it’s best to stagger pruning over two seasons rather than doing it all at once. Cut one side and the top in the first year, leaving the other side to the second year. If your hedge is slow to regrow after the first prune, postpone the second cut back for a further twelve months.\n\nBeech trees\nAllow your young specimen trees to keep their lower side branches until the crown has matured a little. This is to discourage the formation of more than one leading shoot (multiple leaders spoil the shape of the tree and can be prone to failure if allowed to mature) and to protect the main stem from sun scorch.\n\nPrune a beech tree, if necessary, between autumn and early spring. It is usual to create a clear trunk of 2.4-3m (8-10ft) to allow the sweeping lower branches some space to develop. Cuts with a diameter larger than 6cm (2½in) may not heal so readily so try to keep these to a minimum. ",
    "propagating": "The easiest method to propagate beech (Fagus sylvatica) is from seed by collecting ripe beech nuts or ‘masts’ in late summer or autumn. You can either sow them straight away or store them in the fridge to sow in February which helps avoid rodent problems in winter. Sow seeds individually in deep, narrow containers such as Rootrainers and place them outdoors. Alternatively, sow directly into a sandy seed bed. Seeds germinate at 10°C (50°F). Seedlings collected from purple or copper-leaved trees are likely to vary in the level of red or purple pigmentation.\r\n\r\nGrowing from seed is a cheap technique for propagating large numbers of beech plants such as when you need them for hedging. It takes a little longer than buying plants but beech is quick growing so can be worth it. To grow seedling beech to a reasonable size, i.e. 30-60cm (1-2ft) before planting them out as hedge plants, lift and replant the saplings in the same soil 18 months after germination (after two seasons’ growth). This deliberate root disturbance encourages a branched, fibrous root system to develop, rather than a single deep tap root, helping the young beech plants to establish quickly when they are planted in their final position.\n",
    "disease": "Once established beech are pretty reliable but watch out for the following:\r\n- Woolly beech aphids can look alarming but don’t usually do much damage\r\n- Protect young plants from rabbit and deer stripping which can quickly ring bark trees especially in cold weather or after snowfall\r\n- Beech heart rots caused by the fungus Ganoderma can weaken mature trees, causing them to fail\r\n- Signs of ill health or the death of mature beech trees or hedging can also be due to the very common disease honey fungus\r\nProlonged drought will cause beech trees to suffer.",
    "meaning": "Some of the various symbolism of the beech tree include learning, wisdom, understanding, sustenance, knowledge, preservation, longevity, and progress.",

Pruning later during August, when the new growth has hardened off and slowed down, should help minimise leaf damage due to weather conditions or disease and the hedge should remain neat through the winter months.\r\n\r\nOld, neglected plants usually respond well to hard pruning in late spring (May) and can be cut back to within 15-30cm (6in-1ft) of the ground.",

A heated propagator will speed the rooting process, and you should see roots after eight weeks, as opposed to up to eight months without heat.\n\nGrow on the cuttings, pinching out the tips regularly. In the autumn plant out into a nursery bed, spacing plants 30-45cm (1ft-18in) apart and grow on for three to four years.\n\nFor growing from seed, sow seed in autumn or early spring and place in a cold frame.

Leaves\r\n- Excessive sunlight can cause discoloration and sun-scald to leaves\r\n- General bronzing or an orange coloration of the foliage is also due to environmental stress usually following hot, dry spells in summer, although a contributing factor may be root damage due to winter waterlogging\r\n- General yellowing of foliage may be symptomatic of waterlogging, especially on heavy clay soils\r\n- Over winter, leaf tips and margins commonly yellow due to low temperatures\r\n- Leaf discoloration will tend to be more common in exposed sites\r\n- Young growth in spring can also get caught by frost, turning them pale brown and often papery-looking\r\nAn application of fertiliser in spring to encourage fresh new growth, along with clipping, usually rectifies these problems.\r\n\r\n2. Roots\r\nRoots subjected to waterlogging are usually a blue-black colour in cross section and fall apart when teased out. Damaged roots should be removed, top growth trimmed back and the box replanted.\r\n\r\n3. Pest and diseases\r\nBox may sometimes suffer from the following problems: box sucker, box tree caterpillar, plant establishment problems, red spider mite and scale insects. If in doubt, our page on box problems is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nBox blight and other problems can be a considerable issue, making it almost impossible to grow neat, unaffected hedges.

    "instruction": "If your rose plants come bare-root, remove the packing around the roots and soak them in a bucket of water for at least two hours and up to 24 hours. Dig a planting hole large enough to spread out the roots, usually 12 to 18 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nAs with many cultivated flowers, hybrid teas are bud grafted onto hardy, disease-resistant rootstock. The bud union is the visible knob at the base of the plant. In warm climates, the bud union should be one to two inches above soil level. In colder climates, bury the bud union one to two inches below ground level. This union should always be protected in cold winters.",
    "watering": "As with most garden plants, one to two inches of water per week is usually sufficient, but this varies by climate and growing conditions. Hot locations and sandy soil will need more frequent watering than cool, coastal regions. A simpler rule is to water when the top three inches of soil are dry.\r\n\r\nWater the soil, not the leaves, to prevent disease. Also, water deeply to encourage root growth. Strong, deep roots will help your roses survive periods of drought.",
    "sunrequirements": "Full sun",
    "prunetrain": "Pruning hybrid teas is not unlike pruning other rose type. If you are regularly cutting the blossoms, you will actually have less pruning to do. Prune in early spring, before new growth. First cut out anything dead, diseased, or damaged canes as well as scrawny, spindly canes of less than 1/2 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nPrune remaining stronger canes by about a third of their length, down to 12 to 24 inches. Hard-pruning like this encourages strong stems and large flowers. It also opens and shapes the plant so it can put more energy into fewer flowers.\r\n\r\nWhen cutting roses, be sure to leave a few leaves on the stem, making cuts about 1/4 inch above an outward-facing bud. Make the cuts at a 45-degree angle so that water runs off of the cut ends.",
    "meaning": "Each color offers a distinct meaning: red, the lover's rose, signifies enduring passion; white, humility and innocence; yellow, expressing friendship and joy; pink, gratitude, appreciation and admiration; orange, enthusiasm and desire; white lilac and purple roses represent enchantment and love at first sight.",

If the plant has outgrown its allotted space, cut back hard to within 60cm (2ft) of the base. Re-growth will be vigorous, so select strong shoots for training into the new framework, and remove unwanted shoots. The plant will take two or three years to start flowering again.",

Now it takes about six to eight weeks for the plant to unfold its flowers.",
    "watering": "During the flowering and growth phases Hippeastrum need a lot of water.\n- water until the soil becomes moist\n- since the bulb is slightly rotten, the plant should not be watered from above.

This simulates the dry phase, which the plant is accustomed to from its subtropical home. In this way you initiate the dormant period and allow the plant to extract important nutrients from the leaves and store them in the bulb. During the dormant period the plant is not watered.\nWhen the bulb re-sprouts at the end of the dormant period, start again with the water supply. However, the shoot should be one to two inches high before you water it. If you start too early, it stimulates leaf growth, which can lead to a lack of flowers.",

Lavender does not break new growth easily from old stems so don't cut back into the woody stems.\n\nEven if pruned annually, older lavender plants can become straggly, very woody and mis-shapen so, as they are fast growing and establish quickly, they are best replaced if you want to keep everything looking neat.",
    "propagating": "You can easily make more lavender by taking softwood or semi-ripe cuttings from young plants in early to midsummer.

    "commonname": "Sweet corn",
    "othername": "Zea mays",
    "type": "Grass",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "time": "All year round",
    "instruction": "Direct-seed your sweet corn in loamy soil and full light. Be sure the plants are deeply watered weekly, and provide plenty of fertilizer. It can take between 60 and 90 days for corn plants to be ready to harvest.\r\n\r\nThe size of your corn plants will vary with the type of corn you are growing and the growing conditions, but most corn plants average between six and eight feet tall. There are shorter varieties for gardens with limited space.",
    "watering": "Water regularly, especially if you notice the leaves curling and when the cobs begin to swell. It is better to water deeply once a week, rather than providing a little water daily. Keep the area free of weeds that will compete for food and water",
    "sunrequirements": "Full Sun",
    "propagating": "Sweet corn does not transplant well from seedlings unless you are using a biodegradable pot. The best way to propagate sweet corn is direct-seeded after any danger of frost has passed. Because corn is pollinated by the wind, it does best when planted in blocks rather than rows. Pollen from the male tassels needs to make contact with the female silks and close planting means more contact. Wind pollination also results in easy cross-pollination, so keep different type of corn separated by at least 25 feet or plant varieties that mature at different times.",
    "meaning": "In the Bible, the word “corn” is used for grains, in general, and is used symbolically to indicate spiritual goodness. With its many seeds, corn is also a symbol of fertility and rebirth. In Vietnam, it symbolizes the perfection.",

Set up trellises, cages, or stakes at time. Dig planting holes 18 to 24 inches apart if you plan to stake or trellis the crops, 36 to 48 inches apart if the plants aren't trained. Pinch off two or three of the lower branches on the transplant and set the root ball of the plant well into the hole until the remaining lowest leaves are just above the soil surface.

    "time": "Spring or Fall",
    "instruction": "Tulips need a chilling period and are planted in the fall. Planting depth should be about 3 times the bulb's diameter; small bulbs will be about 5 to 6 inches deep, larger bulbs 8 to 10 inches. Add a handful of bulb food or bone meal at time and water well. If it doesn't rain, you must water the bulbs weekly until the ground freezes. Feed again, when the leaves emerge in the spring.",
    "watering": "- If it rains weekly, do not water. However, if there is a dry spell and it does not rain, you should water the bulbs weekly until the ground freezes. \n- Rainy summers, irrigation systems, and wet soil are death to tulips. Never deliberately water a bulb bed unless in a drought. Wet soil leads to fungus and disease and can rot bulbs. Add shredded pine bark, sand, or any other rough material to the soil to foster swift drainage.\n- In the spring, when leaves emerge, feed your tulip the same bulb food or bone meal which you used at time. Water well.",
    "sunrequirements": "Full sun",
    "prunetrain": "Tulips do not need pruning or training. Simply remove the withered stems and foliage in summer once they have turned straw-coloured. Stems usually come away easily without needing to cut them.   ",
    "propagating": "By offsets: These are immature bulbs that naturally form around the main bulb. They can be detatched when lifting plants and stored dry over summer. Replant offsets in autumn at least 20cm (8in) deep. Small offsets may take three to four years to reach flowering size. \r\n\r\nBy seed: Try this method with smaller Specialist tulips, as Border type don't produce seed readily. Sow papery seed collected in the current year in pots or trays of loam-based compost such as Melcourt SylvaGrow with added John Innes. Lightly cover the seed with sieved compost, and finish with a ½cm (¼in) inch layer of horticultural grit. Seed need chilling to germinate, so leave container outdoors. Seedlings appear in spring and typically take three to four years to reach flowering size.",
    "disease": "Tulips sometimes suffer from pest and diseases, especially where grown in the same soil for long periods. Growing conditions may also affect their health.  \n\n- Where plants fail to flower, feed with tomato fertiliser while in growth. This boosts the nutrients returned to the bulb, helping to form flowers for next year. On wetter soils, that don't dry out in summer, reflowering of border tulips is difficult  \n- Many smaller bulbs that do not flower is caused by shallow planting. Replant bulbs at least three times their depth in the ground \n- Tulips with short stems maybe due to late planting, or mild winters    \n- Grey squirrels often dig up bulbs. In containers protect bulbs with chicken wire. In the ground plant bulbs in aquatic baskets covered with chicken wire. Wire can be removed once leaves emerge  \n- Aphids may affect stored bulbs as well as leaves \n- During early spring, slugs can damage foliage and flowers  \n- Streaking and spotting on the petals and leaves indicates tulip viruses, but can also be tulip fire, or grey mould (botrytis)  \n- Tulip fire causes brown spotting and distortion to the petals and leaves. Less frequently distortion can also be caused by stem and bulb eelworm   \n- Soil-borne fungal disease sclerotinia leads to bulb rot. Promptly remove affected plants and don't plant bulbs in this area for five years. Rots can also affect bulbs in storage ",
    "meaning": "The meaning of tulips is generally perfect love. Like many flowers, different colors of tulips also often carry their own significance.

Trailing varieties are exquisite in hanging baskets and tumbling over the edge of containers and window boxes. They are standouts in bouquets and arrangements. You’ll notice the flower's scents more when they’re indoors.\r\n\r\nOutdoors, the mounded plants make a lovely edging along a path or to define a garden border. Violas are as at home in woodland settings as they are filling crevices in rock walls. Combine them with other cool weather lovers like snapdragons, calendula, and Dianthus. Or tuck violas between spring flowering bulbs such as tulips and daffodils to fill the space as the bulbs fade.",

    "sunrequirements": "Full sun",
    "prunetrain": "To promote blooming and extend the flowering period, remove or deadhead faded flowers by pinching off the blooms at the base of the flower stem. You can revive leggy or overgrown plants by cutting them back to about 3 to 4 inches tall. To avoid gray mold, don’t let your plants sit in cool, wet conditions. Make sure your violas get plenty of sunshine and have good air circulation. If you notice aphids, wash the plants off with a strong stream of water, or, for severe problems, treat with insecticidal soap.",
    "propagating": "Violas are easy to start from seed. They are quite happy to self-seed all over your garden. If you would like to start your own indoors, the process is very straightforward.\r\n\r\nStart seed about 4 to 6 weeks before transplanting. Violas can withstand some freezing temperatures, so cold climate gardeners can pick a transplant date that is about 4 weeks before your last expected frost date. Warm climate gardeners transplanting in the fall should start their seeds in mid-summer",
