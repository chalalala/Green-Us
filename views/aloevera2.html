					<h1>Planting</h1>
					<p>When growing aloe vera plants, plant them in a cactus potting soil mix or a regular potting soil that has been amended with additional perlite or building sand. Also, make sure that the pot has plenty of drainage holes. Aloe vera plants cannot tolerate standing water. One important thing in the care of aloe vera houseplants is that they have proper light. Aloe vera plants need bright light, so they do best in south- or west-facing windows.</p>

					<h1>Watering</h1>
					<p>The soil of the aloe vera plant should be allowed to go completely dry before being watered. When the aloe plant is watered, the soil should be thoroughly drenched, but the water should be allowed to drain freely from the soil. The most common reason an aloe plant dies is that the owners water too often or do not allow the water to drain. Do not make this mistake when taking care of aloe houseplants.</p>

					<h1>Pruning and Training</h1>
					<p>To prune it, you must wait until spring arrives. Once the moment arrives, take a sharp knife (not a saw) and cut the blade from its base , close to the ground. To use the gel, it is recommended to take those that are located closer to the ground level, which are the oldest. The newest ones must be left, otherwise the plant would weaken.<br/>If your plant has any leaf that is dry or damaged, it should be removed. It is not a plant that is affected by many pests and diseases, but if it has suffered excessive watering or has been very exposed to the sun, then we will have to “rejuvenate” it by removing those that have lost their green color.<br/>Likewise, if you have small leaves, you can remove them and plant them in individual pots. To do this, you just have to remove a bit of earth around it, and separate them from the mother plant when they are at least 5cm tall . It is important that they get out with a little root, but if some are broken, do not worry. Once you are in your new pot, in a few days you will begin to broadcast new ones.

					<h1>Propagating</h1>
					<p>The Division Method\n\nStep 1: Search for the pups on and around your aloe plant’s stem. Not only will they be at the stem, pups may be hiding at the base of the mother plant. They may be fully obscured by their mother’s large leaves. Each offset should have at least a few leaves and its own root system.<br/>Step 2: Take the entire plant, pups and all, out of its pot and brush away as much soil as possible. If planted in a garden bed, use a trowel to carefully loosen the soil and remove the aloe plant and its pups. Be careful not to disturb other plants growing nearby. Be careful of the root systems for both the parent aloe plant and its offsets.<br/>Step 3: Gently untangle the pups from the mother plant. If needed, use a knife to cut them free, but don’t cut the roots. Take your time with this step so that you cause as little damage as possible.<br/>Step 4: Now that it’s separated, examine the offset’s roots for any damage. Cut free rotten or unhealthy portions, keeping as much of the root intact as possible. You may want to check the mother plant’s roots for damage as well.<br/>Step 5: For offsets with few or damaged roots, dip the ends in rooting hormone to encourage new growth. While this is not always essential, rooting hormone does help with root development.<br/>Step 6: Repot the offset in dry, well-draining soil. The roots need to breathe, so don’t pack down the soil tightly. While the pups are small, they still need to adjust to the fresh soil around their root system.<br/>Step 7: Put the mother plant back in its pot. You may also use this chance to upgrade its pot for a larger one. Whether you’re doing aloe vera repotting or another plant, it’s the same process. Plants should be at the same depth they were growing at in their old pot. The same is true if your plants were in a garden bed.<br/>Step 8: It’s tempting to give your baby aloe plant some water as a housewarming gift. However, keep it dry for a few days. The roots need time to heal from the move, which is best done while the soil’s dry. Gradually begin to water your plants again after a few days to a week have passed.

					<h1>Problems</h1>
					<p>Water issues have got to be the number one cause of problems with aloe vera. A wilting, brown aloe that has soft spots in the leaves is likely over watered. A plant with puckered leaves that are discoloring may be too dry. The leaves are a great indicator of the moisture needs of this plant. They should be plump and glossy green.\n\nTo correct any water issues, repot the plant in a well-draining soil that is at least half gritty material such as sand or pumice. Once the plant is out of soil, check the roots for any rot and remove. Water only when the soil is dry to the touch when you insert a finger to the second knuckle. In winter, reduce water by half.</p>
