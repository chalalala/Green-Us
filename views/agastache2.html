					<h1>Planting</h1>
					<p>Planting bareroot perennials:<br>1. Begin by preparing the soil. If you are creating a new border, consider double digging otherwise remove the weeds and single dig<br>2. Arrange the bareroot clumps on the surface so you can see how they will look<br>3. Next, use a trowel or spade to create a hole just deep and wide enough to set in the clump. The aim is to bury just the roots, leaving the bases of the stems (when in growth in summer) and/or the shoots (in spring) above ground<br>4. Firm back around the soil, using your hand for small clumps and your heels on large ones<br>5. Water in well even if the ground is moist and rain is forecast. This will settle the soil and prevent desiccation<br><br>Planting container-grown perennials:<br>1. Begin by preparing the soil. If you are creating a new border, consider double digging otherwise remove the weeds and single dig<br>2. Arrange the container-grown perennials on the surface so you can see how they will look before planting<br>3. Individually knock out each plant from its container. Look at the roots – if they are circling around the compost, it is best to tease them out. To do this, push your fingers into the rootball along the bottom edge and pull to rip the roots. Do this in three to four places. This will prevent the roots growing round and round and, therefore, should encourage the roots to spread into the surrounding ground<br>4. Next use a trowel or spade to create a hole just deep and wide enough to set in the rootball. The aim is to bury just the roots, leaving the bases of the stems (when in growth in summer) or the shoots (in spring) above ground<br>5. Firm back around the soil, using your hand for small clumps and your heels on large ones<br>6. Water in well even if the ground is moist and rain is forecast.

					<h1>Watering</h1>
					<p>Water newly planted perennials regularly for their first year, until they’re settled in. After that, most only need extra water during long dry spells.<br>Perennials in containers should be watered regularly during the growing season, and especially in hot weather.</p>

					<h1>Pruning and Training</h1>
					<p>Perennials need little pruning. However, there are two instances where it is needed:<br>Cutting back – herbaceous perennials die back in late autumn and the dead stems should be cut off at the base before new shoots appear in spring. If you leave them in place over winter, some may look a little untidy, but will provide valuable shelter for overwintering beneficial insects.<br>Chelsea chop – perennials that are liable to flop can be reduced in height in late May to produce stockier plants or delay flowering.</p>

					<h1>Propagating</h1>
					<p>Perennials are easy to propagate in several ways:<br>- by dividing the clump<br>- by taking cuttings – either softwood or semi-ripe, or root cuttings<br>- by growing from seed, either bought or saved from your plants </p>

					<h1>Problems</h1>
					<p>Perennials, especially hardy ones, are usually robust and trouble free. However, look out for the following problems:<br>- Nibbled young shoots and holey leaves may be caused by slugs, snails, rabbits and mice.<br>- Yellow leaves (chlorosis) may be a sign of nutrient deficiency.<br>- Tall or top-heavy flower stems may flop over or break – put supports in place in spring.<br>- Plants may occasionally go into decline for no apparent reason – this often starts with browning leaves and may be caused by a disease such as phytophthora or pythium root rot.</p>
